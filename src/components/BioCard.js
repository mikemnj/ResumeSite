            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Michael McCully, and I am a twenty-one-year-old student currently studying Information Systems at the University of Delaware. As an Information Systems student, I am dedicated to developing proficiency in various skills including programming, mathematics, accounting, and business administration, all while approaching these concepts from a systems perspective.

                My time working in the service industry began at the age of fifteen, where I have held roles such as busser, bar-back, prep-cook, and delivery driver. Through these experiences, I have gained excellent interpersonal, problem-solving, and leadership skills, which I believe are invaluable in a professional setting.

                In addition to my academic pursuits and work experience, I am an active member of the Delta Chi Fraternity at the University of Delaware, where I have had the privilege of serving on the Executive Board. This role has provided me with valuable insights into organizational responsibilities, including member conflict resolution, event coordination, and financial accountability.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about leveraging my professional experiences and skill set to make meaningful contributions in both academic and professional settings, and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
